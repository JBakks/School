# Assignment #1
## Purpose of the Assignment
To pull data through the NHL's open data API. Display scores for all of the regular season games of the 2022-2023 season that have been played so far (I also made it so you could see current games being played).

## Learning Outcomes
- Object-oriented programming using C++, using basic language constructs, classes, and data types.
- Looking through Unix/Linux manual pages and documentation.
- Getting acquainted with Unix/Linux-based programming and services, which will help in project development on this environment later in the course.

## Running Guide
Put the files in the same directory, run the make file using command "make" then run the program with ./main

## User Guide
After running the project wait for about 2 minutes while the program calls the api for each played game.

OpenGL Waves

This is a project created by Josh Bakelaar that uses the OpenGL library to render 3D waves

The marching cubes algorithm is a well-known algorithm used to create 3D models from volumetric data. It uses a series of cubes to generate a smooth surface that represents the shape of the original data. 
Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

    OpenGL library (minimum version: OpenGL 3.3)
    CMake (minimum version: 3.12)

Installation

    Clone the repository to your local machine
    Navigate to the project directory
    Create a new directory called "build" and navigate into it
    Run the following command to generate the makefiles: cmake ..
    Run the following command to build the project: make
    Run the executable using ./opengl-shapes-marching-cubes

Usage

The program will open a window that displays a 3D shape generated using the marching cubes algorithm. You can use the following keyboard shortcuts to interact with the shape:

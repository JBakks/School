I chose to do Option 2: A 2D Adventure for my APP 2.

# Resubmission Changes
- Added restart button to pause screen
- Deleted top scores on leaderboard so you will be able to see your times. I looked on the leaderboard service and saw your scores, they were just not above the top 10 so they didnt show up in game. Scores are time based like the assignment guidelines says, whatever your finish time is thats your score. Therefore a lower score is higher on the leaderboard.
# Controls

- A and D (left or right) -> Moves the player side to side
- J -> Melee attack
- K -> Ranged attack
- W -> Jump

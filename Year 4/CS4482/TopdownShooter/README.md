The tutorial that I chose to complete was from Unity's Create with Code. I followed both unit 1 & 2. This game is an edit from prototype 2, where you're a farmer throwing food at animals to make them leave.

# Controls

- A and D (left or right) -> Moves the player side to side
- Space -> Shoots the food

# Edits Made

I added powerups (represented by other food items), which fall from the top of the screen.

- Pizza -> Turns your food shot into a triple shot.
- Soda -> Gives you speed boost

# Resources Used
- [Create with Code](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code?uv=2020.3)
- Chatgpt was used for some of the PowerUpCollision, and PlayerController Scripts

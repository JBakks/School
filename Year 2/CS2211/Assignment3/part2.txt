Part 2

1) Files

	1) You can use the command "echo *" you can pass things as arguments as well, but with no argument it will print out the files
	2) you need to add the flag -i to prompt before a removal, adding -f will force to remove the file and never prompt. -f will always take precedence
	3) The big differences are that rename cannot move a file where mv can, mv can also overwrite files which were already there
	4) ELF stands for Executable and Linking Format
	5) du will show the disk usage of the file, how much of the file system is used by it, where ls -l says the file size 
2) Directories
	1) mkdir -p grandparent/parent/child
	2) you would have to add a \ infront of the space "mkdir hello\ world" the same would go for removing it "rm -r hello\ world"
	3) mkdir -m500 helloworld
	4) "cd -"
	5) "cd.. 6" then use "pwdx" 
3) Permissions
	1) -c needs to be added to chmod
	2) -reference=file1 will match the permissions set to file1
	3) -c '%A %a %n' (FILE NAME) needs to be added
	4) chmod 020 (FILE NAME)
	5) +x will add the execute permission.
